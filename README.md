# Software-Engineering-Research-Development
My contribution to the Software Engineering Module 2020
This project was set around the development of a 'Monopoly' like game called Property Tycoon.
I undertook the role 'Head of Research & Development', along with being in-charge of creating the Planning documentation (PERT & Gantt), with some High-Level & Low-Level designs made on the side.
All work created by myself has been included.
